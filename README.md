# Claude Code Delegator

Delegate implementation plans from an orchestrating AI (e.g., Codex) to Claude Code for execution, then review the resulting diff — all in a plan-execute-review loop.

## Overview

This skill/toolkit lets an orchestrating AI (like Codex) own the planning and review phases while Claude Code handles implementation. The workflow is:

1. **Plan** — Orchestrator reads context and produces a concrete plan.
2. **Execute** — Orchestrator invokes Claude Code via the bundled wrapper to execute the plan.
3. **Review** — Orchestrator inspects the diff and test results.
4. **Correct** (optional) — One targeted correction pass if needed.
5. **Report** — Final summary with changed files, tests, and residual risk.

## Components

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `SKILL.md` | Skill definition — the contract that drives orchestrator behavior |
| `scripts/run-claude-code.sh` | Wrapper that invokes Claude Code with consistent flags |
| `scripts/compact-claude-stream.py` | Compacts JSON stream output into a readable final report |
| `scripts/jira-safe-text.py` | Strips Markdown for Jira MCP plain-text comments |
| `tests/run_tests.sh` | Test runner |

## Usage

```bash
# Default (pro model, quiet output)
./scripts/run-claude-code.sh "your prompt here"

# Flash model
./scripts/run-claude-code.sh --flash "your prompt here"

# Stream output (for debugging)
./scripts/run-claude-code.sh --stream "your prompt here"

# Environment variable overrides
CLAUDE_DELEGATOR_MODEL='deepseek-v4-flash[1m]' \
CLAUDE_DELEGATOR_EFFORT=medium \
CLAUDE_DELEGATOR_PERMISSION_MODE=acceptEdits \
  ./scripts/run-claude-code.sh "your prompt here"
```

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview) installed and configured
- Access to a Claude Code-compatible model
- `python3` available for the JSON compactor
